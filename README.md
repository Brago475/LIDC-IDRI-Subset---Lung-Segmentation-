# Lung Segmentation Project

This project focuses on lung segmentation using medical imaging data. The goal is to preprocess and analyze lung scans, 
applying image processing or deep learning techniques to isolate lung regions for further medical analysis.

## Features
- Loads and processes lung scan images
- Applies segmentation techniques (e.g., UNet or thresholding)
- Visualizes original and segmented images side by side

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- google collab.
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `segmentation_models_pytorch`

## How to Run
1. Open the `Lung_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run each cell step-by-step inside google collab.

## Notes
Make sure to have your image dataset properly organized before running the notebook.
